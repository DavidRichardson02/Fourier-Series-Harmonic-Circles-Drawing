# Fourier-Series-Harmonic-Circles-Drawing
See the attached document for a detailed explanation of the program. My first real project, no real uses but a cool visualization of the geometric representation of the Discrete Fourier Transform. Made in c++ openframeworks, also the custom vector class thing is only there cause I wasn't allowed to use std::vector in my class.
