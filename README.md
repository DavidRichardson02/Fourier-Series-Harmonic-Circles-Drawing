# Fourier-Series-Harmonic-Circles-Drawing
Drawing an arbitrary 2D path with the fourier series. See the attached document for a detailed explanation of the program. Based on some interesting math and serves as a cool visualization of the geometric representation of the Discrete Fourier Transform. Made in c++ openframeworks.
